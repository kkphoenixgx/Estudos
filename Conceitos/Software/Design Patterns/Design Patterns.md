## Tipos de design patterns


* **Creational Design Patterns** = Lidam com o problema de criação de objetos, uma classe não pode ter a responsabilidade de criar um objeto. Delega isso para uma Factory, etc. 
* **Structural Design Patterns**: Lidam com a composição de objetos
* **Behavioral Design Patterns**: Lidam com comunicação de objetos

This is one of the most essential ingredients of a good pattern. Does not have an obvious solution We can find that problem-solving techniques often attempt to derive from well-known first principles. The best design patterns usually provide solutions to issues indirectly—this is considered a necessary approach for the most challenging problems related to design. Describes a proven concept Design patterns require proof that they function as described, and without this proof, the design cannot be seriously considered. If a pattern is highly speculative in nature, only the brave will attempt to use it. Describes a relationship In some cases, it may appear that a pattern describes a type of module. Despite what the implementation looks like, the official description of the pattern must describe much deeper system structures and mechanisms that explain its relationship to code. ~Addy Osmany - Learn Javascript Design Patterns Second Edition</i></p>

Applicability Is the design worthy of being a pattern because it has broader applicability? If so, this needs to be explained. When reviewing or defining a pattern, it is vital to keep these areas in mind. ~Addy Osmany - Learn Javascript Design Patterns Second Edition</i></p>
