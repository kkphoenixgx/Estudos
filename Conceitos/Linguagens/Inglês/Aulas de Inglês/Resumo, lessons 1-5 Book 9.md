## Lesson 1

### **Used to** 

In the lesson one we studied that when we are speaking of something that we used to do, we are speaking of something that we generally did in the past but now a days we don't do it anymore.

So the structure we use in English to express that ideia is:

Exemple :  I used to went to baseball games when I was young.
				 We used to visit our grandmother when we ware little.

That ideia can also be expressed using the past tense + phrase + past time

### **Were like used to**

We can also say that something happened in the past but don't happens anymore using would + past time

Exemple:  We would always be good some time ago
				Those barbarians would be good in medieval times
